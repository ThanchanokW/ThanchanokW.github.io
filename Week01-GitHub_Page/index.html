            <img src="insomnia-concept_23-2148644671.jpg">
            <p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep, or cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake up. Insomnia can sap not only your energy level and mood but also your health, work performance and quality of life.

                How much sleep is enough varies from person to person, but most adults need seven to eight hours a night.
                
                At some point, many adults experience short-term (acute) insomnia, which lasts for days or weeks. It's usually the result of stress or a traumatic event. But some people have long-term (chronic) insomnia that lasts for a month or more. Insomnia may be the primary problem, or it may be associated with other medical conditions or medications.
                
                You don't have to put up with sleepless nights. Simple changes in your daily habits can often help.</p>
